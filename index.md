<!--# About Me-->
I am a fifth year grad student at UW-Madison. Advised by [Dimitris Papailiopoulos](https://papail.io/) and [Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/) . 
My research interests are primarily in Systems for Machine Learning, especially around distributed training and inference of ML workloads. Prior to grad school I spent ~two very formative years at [Mad Street Den](https://www.madstreetden.com/) when it used to be early stage in a basement with 6 people. I also have significant amount of consulting experience, building large scale infrastructure for ML deployment and data management. 

When I am not being a grad student, I can be found racing keelboats on Lake Mendota or alpine skiing in the winters. I also double up as a sailing instructor at the UW-Madison Sailing club.
